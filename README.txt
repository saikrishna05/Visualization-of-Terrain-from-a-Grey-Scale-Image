Step 1: Download and install imageJ software.

Step 2: Open the gray scale in imageJ and save it as text file. This generates the text file which contains the z axis values of the image.

Step 3: install vtk and cmake with default settings and install visual studio 2017 with c++ libraries.

Step 4: Make sure to include the path in environment variables. Save the .txt file generated by imageJ in debug folder.

Step 5: Type the code in visual studio and build the project. Run the project throught the debug command or by running the .exe file in the debug foulder of the path.



*Our program prints all the z values which are being read from the .txt file.
